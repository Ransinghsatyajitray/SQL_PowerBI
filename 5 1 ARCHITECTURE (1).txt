SQL SERVER ARCHITETURE:

	PROTOCOLS	:	NETWORK PROGRAMS USED TO TRANSFER THE QUERIES FROM CLIENT (SSMS TOOL) TO THE SERVER.
				AND ALSO TRANSFER THE QUERY RESULT FROM SERVER BACK TO TOOLS. TYPES OF PROTOCOLS:
			*****	TCP/IP	:	TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL. USED FOR CLIENT - SERVER COMMUNICATION OVER INTERNET.
				NAMED PIPES:	USED FOR CLIENT - SERVER COMMUNICATION OVER LAN [LOCAL AREA NETWORK]
				SHARED MEMORY:	USED FOR CLIENT - SERVER COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE SAME OPERATING SYSTEM.
				VIA	:	USED FOR CLIENT - SERVER COMMUNICATION OVER INTERNET. LESS SECURE. DEPRECATED.

	DATABASE ENGINE		
	QUERY PROCESSING ENGINE	1. PARSER :	USED TO IDENTIFY NAMES AND KEYWORDS OF T-SQL QUERIES. 
						CONVERT FROM HIGH LEVEL SQL QUERY FORMAT TO LOW LEVEL MACHINE CODE [COMPILATION]. 
				2. OPTIMIZER:	USED TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO EXECUTE THE QUERIES. (EX: TABLE SCAN)
				3. SQL MANAGER: USED TO ALLOCATE QUERY RESOURCES = PROCESSOR & MEMORY
				4. DB MANAGER:  USED TO LOCATE THE TABLE INSIDE THE DATABASE : DATA FILE
				5. EXECUTOR: 	USED TO PERFORM ACTUAL EXECUTION OF THE QUERY USING STORAGE ENGINE COMPONENTS.

				STORAGE ENGINE
				6. TRANSACTION SERVICES: USED TO INITIATE NEW TRANSACTIONS FOR EVERY QUERY WE EXECUTE. 
							 TRANSACTION MEANS COMPLETE EXECUTION OR NOTHING. EX: COMPLETE INSERT OR NOTHING
				7. FILE MANAGER	:	 USED TO ALLOCATE SPACE FOR DATABASE DATA FILE(S) AND LOG FILE(S)
				8. BUFFER MANAGER:	 USED TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL MEMORY (BUFFER SPACE) FOR VARIABLES, PARAMETERS,ETC..
				9. LOCK MANAGER : 	 USED TO ALLOCATE LOCKS ON DATABASE & TABLES DURING THEIR ACCESS SO THAT OTHER
							 USERS SHOULD NOT / CANNOT REMOVE THEM.
				10. UTILITIES
				    ACCESS METHODS	 USED BY DATABASE ADMINISTRATOS FOR BACKUPS, SECURITY MANAGEMENT, REPAIRS, ETC..

	SQL OS API		LOCK MANAGER			USED TO ALLOCATE OPERATING SYSTEM LOCKS ON DATABASE FILES (mdf & ldf)
				SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICES:	USED TO PERFORM AUTOMATED ACTIVITIES IN OS BASED ON QUERY EXECUTIONS.
				THREAD SCHEDULER:		THREADS MEANS INDIVIDUAL PROCESSES. THESE CAN BE SCHEDULED USING "JOBS"
				BUFFER POOL & MEMORY MANAGER:	USED TO LOCK REQUIRED MEMORY FROM OS AND ALLOCATE IT TO SQL SERVER
				IO MANAGER:			USED TO PERFORM AND MONITOR INPUT & OUTPUT OPERATIONS.
				LAZY WRITER:			TO WRITE TRANSACTION DATA FROM MEMORY TO DATABASE LOG FILE.
				CHECKPOINT:			TO WRITE TRANSACTION DATA FROM DATABASE LOG FILE TO DATA FILE.
				WAL:				WRITE AHEAD LOG. USED TO CONTROL LAZY WRITER AND CHECKPOINT PROCESSES. 

				MDAC:				MICROSOFT DATA ACCCESS COMPONENT. TO COMMUNICATE WITH LOCAL, REMOTE SERVER
				CLR:				COMMON LANGUAGE RUNTIME. A SET OF LIBRARIES FOR BI COMPONENTS.

	--------------------------------
	BATCH			A COLLECTION OF SQL STATEMENTS
				PURPOSE:	BATCH IS USED TO CONTROL THE QUERY SUBMISSION FROM CLIENT TO SERVER 
						THIS MEANS, EITHER COMPLETE BATCH IS SUBMITTED FOR EXECUTION OR NOTHING AT ALL
						
				EX: ASSUME THERE ARE TWO BATCHES.
				    BATCH 1 : A COLLECTION OF THREE INSERT STATEMENTS. 2ND STATEMENT HAS A SYNTAX ERROR.
				    BATCH 2 : A COLLECTION OF THREE INSERT STATEMENTS. NO SYNTAX ERROR. 
				    IF WE EXECUTE BOTH BATCHES TOGETHER THEN 1ST BATCH FAILS COMPLETELY. 2ND BATCH EXECUTES COMPELTELY.
				
				"GO" STATEMENT IS USED TO SEPERATE TWO BATCHES.


	
	CHAR & VARCHAR		CHAR(n) : MEANS n NUMBER OF BYTES ARE RESERVED TO STORE EACH COLUMN VALUE			USERNAME
					  EX: CHAR(5) MEANS 5 BYTES RESERVED. CAN STORE UPTO 5 CHARACTERS.
					      'SQL' NEEDS 3 BYTES. BUT 5 BYTES ARE RESERVED. SO, 2 BYTES ARE UNUSED.

				VARCHAR(m) : MEANS UPTO m  NUMBER OF BYTES ARE RESERVED TO STORE EACH COLUMN VALUE		PASSWORD
					  EX: 	VARCHAR(10) MEANS UPTO 10 BYTES RESERVED. CAN STORE UPTO 10 CHARACTERS.
						'SQL' NEEDS 3 BYTES. SO 3 BYTES ARE RESERVED. SO, NO UNUSED SPACE.
